## Abstract

A very reliable and old method of organic business growth has been word of mouth referrals. Kaching aims to facilitate and incentivise the influencers helping local restaurants and store owners through digital content. To help handle a growth in the customer base and expand operations, a product management problem was devised to automate the process of current manual payouts to the influencers. We presented an analysis of the problem at hand and possible solutions in the form of a service bundle. Relevant metrics are brought out to track success and handle possible pitfalls.
